            Impact on Mental Health
        </h1>
        <div class="mHealth">
            <p>Fear, worry, and stress are normal responses to perceived or real threats, and at times when we are faced
                with uncertainty or the unknown. So it is normal and understandable that people are experiencing fear in
                the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

                Added to the fear of contracting the virus in a pandemic such as COVID-19 are the significant changes to
                our daily lives as our movements are restricted in support of efforts to contain and slow down the
                spread of the virus. Faced with new realities of working from home, temporary unemployment,
                home-schooling of children, and lack of physical contact with other family members, friends and
                colleagues, it is important that we look after our mental, as well as our physical, health.

                WHO, together with partners, is providing guidance and advice during the COVID-19 pandemic for health
                workers, managers of health facilities, people who are looking after children, older adults, people in
                isolation and members of the public more generally, to help us look after our mental health.

                Further materials relating to looking after our mental health during the COVID pandemic will be added to
                this page as they become available.

                The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic recession have negatively affected many people’s mental
                health and created new barriers for people already suffering from mental illness and substance use
                disorders. During the pandemic, about 4 in 10 adults in the U.S. have reported symptoms of anxiety or
                depressive disorder, a share that has been largely consistent, up from one in ten adults who reported
                these symptoms from January to June 2019 (Figure 1). A KFF Health Tracking Poll from July 2020 also
                found that many adults are reporting specific negative impacts on their mental health and well-being,
                such as difficulty sleeping (36%) or eating (32%), increases in alcohol consumption or substance use
                (12%), and worsening chronic conditions (12%), due to worry and stress over the coronavirus. As the
                pandemic wears on, ongoing and necessary public health measures expose many people to experiencing
                situations linked to poor mental health outcomes, such as isolation and job loss.

                This brief explores mental health and substance use during, and prior to, the COVID-19 pandemic. It
                focuses on populations that were particularly at risk for experiencing negative mental health or
                substance abuse consequences during the pandemic, including young adults, people experiencing job loss,
                parents and children, communities of color, and essential workers. We draw on KFF analysis of data from
                the Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey (an ongoing survey created to capture data on health and
                economic impacts of the pandemic), KFF Health Tracking Poll data, and data on mental health prior to the
                COVID-19 pandemic. Key takeaways include: Young adults have experienced a number of pandemic-related
                consequences, such as closures of universities and loss of income, that may contribute to poor mental
                health. During the pandemic, a larger than average share of young adults (ages 18-24) report symptoms of
                anxiety and/or depressive disorder (56%). Compared to all adults, young adults are more likely to report
                substance use (25% vs. 13%) and suicidal thoughts (26% vs. 11%). Prior to the pandemic, young adults
                were already at high risk of poor mental health and substance use disorder, though many did not receive
                treatment. Research from prior economic downturns shows that job loss is associated with increased
                depression, anxiety, distress, and low self-esteem and may lead to higher rates of substance use
                disorder and suicide. During the pandemic, adults in households with job loss or lower incomes report
                higher rates of symptoms of mental illness than those without job or income loss (53% vs. 32%). Research
                during the pandemic points to concerns around poor mental health and well-being for children and their
                parents, particularly mothers, as many are experiencing challenges with school closures and lack of
                childcare. Women with children are more likely to report symptoms of anxiety and/or depressive disorder
                than men with children (49% vs. 40%). In general, both prior to, and during, the pandemic, women have
                reported higher rates of anxiety and depression compared to men. The pandemic has disproportionately
                affected the health of communities of color. Non-Hispanic Black adults (48%) and Hispanic or Latino
                adults (46%) are more likely to report symptoms of anxiety and/or depressive disorder than Non-Hispanic
                White adults (41%). Historically, these communities of color have faced challenges accessing mental
                health care. Many essential workers continue to face a number of challenges, including greater risk of
                contracting the coronavirus than other workers. Compared to nonessential workers, essential workers are
                more likely to report symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorder (42% vs. 30%), starting or increasing
                substance use (25% vs. 11%), and suicidal thoughts (22% vs. 8%) during the pandemic.
